##TODAY LESSON - WEEK 4 ( SUMMARY )

Today Lesson is about Virtual Cloud Network


#VIRTUAL CLOUD NETWORK (VCN)

A virtual, private network that you set up in Oracle data centers. It closely resembles a traditional network, with firewall rules and specific types of communication gateways that you can choose to use. A VCN resides in a single Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region and covers one or more CIDR blocks (IPv4 and IPv6, if enabled). See Allowed VCN Size and Address Ranges. The terms virtual cloud network, VCN, and cloud network are used interchangeably in this documentation. For more information, see VCNs and Subnets.

## Q : Why a Virtual Cloud Network is essential for a post digital-transformation world?

Hardware-centric networks running from physical systems can atrophy otherwise modern organizations looking to implement virtualization and/or Cloud solutions.

Businesses seeking better efficiency and agility are increasingly turning to a software-first approach to provide a network virtualization overlay for automated agility, flexibility, and simplicity, so organizations can move at the speed of software for competitive advantage.

The physical datacentre of old was built to be static with a one-way flow of information. It is entirely unsuited to virtualization and containerized applications for the post-digital transformation world, where the flow of information is ubiquitous and infrastructure must have the ability to scale and be Agile.

This is why a software-first approach via a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) is becoming table stakes for organizations looking to move at speed. The VCN is a software layer across the entire datacentre infrastructure, from physical servers, to public and private Cloud and Edge. It gives the network automated agility, flexibility, and simplicity, allowing the datacentre network to become an enabler of business outcomes, rather than a siloed cost centre.

# A software-first approach has a number of business advantages, including:

**Improving** security by embedding it into the infrastructure, network compartmentalization via micro-segmentation, data encryption, and automatic detection and response to security threats.

**Improving** connectivity and performance by providing a software layer connecting everything, no matter what type of infrastructure it resides in.

**Increasing** agility/app deployment/intelligence by optimizing the deployment of apps and data across the entire business in real-time.

**Reducing** costs and time associated with IT infrastructure and teams, by unifying disparate systems across physical, Cloud and Edge systems, for automatic and continuous availability and resources.
