# PaaS / Platform as a Service 

Platform as a **Service (PaaS) is a suite of services for building and managing modern
applications in the digital ageâ€”on-premise or in the cloud**. PaaS is a standardized, shared, and
elastically scalable application development and deployment platform packaged as a service. These
platforms typically include databases and middleware, as well as development, management,
security, and integration capabilities, all delivered as a service. PaaS provides the infrastructure and
middleware components that enable developers, IT administrators, and end users to build, integrate,
migrate, deploy, secure, and manage mobile and web applications.


PaaS is sometimes referred to as "Shared Services", where PaaS has the idea that each
application requires some unique technology and a business cannot escape rigid deployment scenarios
for packaged and custom applications. PaaS enables organizations to consolidate/merge existing
applications on a common architecture together, as well as build new applications that take advantage
of the shared services provided by the platform. PaaS enables an organization to achieve the fastest
time to reach its target market with the lowest ownership and management costs.
