Resume week 5 by Ahmad Mahfudin Alwi

## 5th Meeting Material

Here we are taught how to create a database on a Virtual Machine (Instance). The database used is Mysql which can be managed via SSH in the command line or using the Graphic User Interface (GUI).

## Material Summary

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a suite of services for building and managing modern applications in the digital-on-premise era or in the cloud. PaaS is a standardized, shared, and elastically scalable application development and deployment platform packaged as a service.

PaaS is sometimes referred to as "Shared Services", where PaaS has the idea that each application requires some unique technology and a business cannot escape rigid deployment scenarios for packaged and custom applications.

#### PaaS Service

<ol>

<li> Artificial intelligence </li>

AI which is artificial intelligence refers to a system or machine that imitates human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve itself based on information
that they collect.

<li> Chatbots </li>

A chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversations (whether written or spoken), enabling humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person.

<li> Blockchain </li>

Blockchain is defined as a decentralized data ledger that is shared securely. Blockchain technology allows a select group of participants to share data.

<li> Internet of Things (IoT) </li>

The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a network of physical objects “Things” embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.

#### PaaS Benefits

<ol>

<li> IT Efficiency </li>
PaaS accelerates provisioning, improves automation, standardizes deployments, eliminates routine tasks, and improves scalability.

<li> Business innovation </li>
PaaS drives top- and bottom-line results by enabling IT to be more responsive to business opportunities such as for mobile applications, support for more innovative user experiences (chatbots), more trusted transactions (blockchain), release cycles faster (containers and APIs), and data discovery (analytics).

<li> Risk reduction </li>
PaaS strengthens and simplifies security and accelerates response to evolving threats across heterogeneous IT components.
