Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a suite of services for building and managing modern applications in the digital age—on-premise or in the cloud. PaaS is a standardized, shared, and elastically scalable application development and deployment platform packaged as a service. These platforms typically include databases and middleware, as well as development, management, security, and integration capabilities, all delivered as a service. PaaS provides the infrastructure and middleware components that enable developers, IT administrators, and end users to build, integrate, migrate, deploy, secure, and manage mobile and web applications.
Importance of Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS is an evolutionary approach to delivering the middleware and database capacity needed to host applications. When fully implemented, PaaS will provide: 
• Fast (near real time) capacity provisioning on physical servers 
• Highly optimized application for server ratios and the ability to turn off spare capacity 
• Proactive cross-domain monitoring and alerting 
• Measurement facility to set usage parameters for PaaS . tenants
Services offered by PaaS
To aid productivity, PaaS offers ready-to-use programming components that allow developers to build new capabilities into their applications, including innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots, blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT).

Advantages of PaaS
IT efficiency: PaaS accelerates provisioning, improves automation, standardizes deployments, eliminates routine tasks, and improves scalability. 
Business innovation: PaaS drives top- and bottom-line results by enabling IT to be more responsive to business opportunities such as for mobile applications, support for more innovative user experiences (chatbots), more trusted transactions (blockchain) ), faster release cycles (containers and APIs), and data discovery (analytics). 
Risk reduction: PaaS strengthens and simplifies security and accelerates response to evolving threats across heterogeneous IT components. This can increase business resilience and reduce downtime while preventing data loss and speeding up recovery.
