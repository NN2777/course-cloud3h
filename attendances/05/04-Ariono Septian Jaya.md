PaaS is a standardized, shared, and elastically scalable application development and deployment platform packaged as a service.
PaaS includes database and middleware, as well as development, management, security, and integration capabilities, all delivered as a service.
To aid productivity, PaaS offers ready-to-use programming components that allow developers to build new capabilities into their applications, including innovative technologies such as:
• Artificial intelligence (AI): artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect.
• Chatbots: Computer programs that simulate and process human conversations (whether written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with real people.
• Blockchain : As a decentralized data ledger that is shared securely. With blockchain cloud services, transactional data from multiple sources can be easily collected, integrated and shared.
• Internet of Things (IoT): describes a network of physical objects²³ Things´² embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet

PaaS services also include solutions for professional IT analysts, end users, and administrators, including big data analytics, content management, database and data management, systems management, and cloud security.

PaaS Benefits
Most IT decisions are justified based on three principles, namely efficiency, effectiveness and risk reduction. solutions provided by PaaS to meet each of these principles:
• IT efficiency: PaaS accelerates provisioning, improves automation, standardizes deployments, eliminates routine tasks, and improves scalability.
• Business innovation: PaaS drives top- and bottom-line results by enabling IT to be more responsive to business opportunities such as for mobile applications, support for more innovative user experiences (chatbots), more trusted transactions (blockchain) ), faster release cycles (containers and APIs), and data discovery (analytics).
• Risk reduction: PaaS strengthens and simplifies security and accelerates response to evolving threats across heterogeneous IT components. This can increase business resilience and reduce downtime while preventing data loss and speeding up recovery.
