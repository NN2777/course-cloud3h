# Platform as a Service (PaaS)

## Definition
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a suite of services for building and managing modern
applications in the digital ageâ€”on-premise or in the cloud. PaaS is a standardized, shared, and
elastically scalable application development and deployment platform packaged as a service. These
platforms typically include databases and middleware, as well as development, management,
security, and integration capabilities, all delivered as a service. PaaS provides the infrastructure and
middleware components that enable developers, IT administrators, and end users to build, integrate,
migrate, deploy, secure, and manage mobile and web applications.

## Importance of Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS is an evolutionary approach to delivering the middleware and database capacity needed to host
applications. When fully implemented, PaaS will provide:
- Fast (near real time) capacity provisioning on physical servers
-  Highly optimized application for server ratios and the ability to turn off spare capacity
- Proactive cross-domain monitoring and alerting- Measurement facility to set usage parameters for PaaS. tenants

## Services offered by PaaS
To aid productivity, PaaS offers ready-to-use programming components that allow developers to
build new capabilities into their applications, including innovative technologies such as artificial
intelligence (AI), chatbots, blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT).
