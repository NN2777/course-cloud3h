PaaS Summary Week 5 :

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a suite of services for building and managing modern applications in the digital age—on-premise or in the cloud. PaaS is a standardized, shared, and elastically scalable application development and deployment platform packaged as a service. These platforms typically include databases and middleware, as well as development, management, security, and integration capabilities, all delivered as a service. PaaS provides the infrastructure and
middleware components that enable developers, IT administrators, and end users to build, integrate, migrate, deploy, secure, and manage mobile and web applications.   

Important of Platform as a Service :
-Fast (near real time) capacity provisioning on physical servers
-Highly optimized application for server ratios and the ability to turn off spare capacity
-Proactive cross-domain monitoring and alerting
-Measurement facility to set usage parameters for PaaS . tenants

Services offered of Platform as a Service :
-Artificial intelligence
AI which is artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines that imitate human intelligence to
perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect

-Chatbots
A chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversations (whether written or spoken), enabling humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person. Chatbots can be simple programs that answer simple questions with one-line responses, or sophisticated Intelligent assistants that learn and evolve to provide increased levels of personalization as they collect and process information.

-Blockchain
Blockchain is defined as a decentralized data ledger that is shared securely. Blockchain technology allows a select group of participants to share data. With blockchain cloud services, transactional data from multiple sources can be easily collected, integrated and shared. The data is broken down into shared blocks that are chained together with a unique identifier in the form of a cryptographic hash

-Internet of Things (IoT)
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a network of physical objects—“Things”—embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from common household items to
sophisticated industrial tools. With more than 7 billion IoT devices connected today, experts predict this number will grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025.
